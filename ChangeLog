- added optional IPv6 support (./configure --enable-ipv6)

- seperated the listening/outgoing connection addresses
  - muh listens on: listenhost = "127.0.0.1";

  if listenhost doesnt exist, the value of bind="" is used.

  never get any further

  and the client determines their own status from the /NAMES reply

  weird that this wasn't an issue in earlier versions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.04 27/02/99

- well err...there's been a bug in rejoining/leaving channels.
  i'm sure i have not made this cause it's been working earlier
  so this must have been done by aliens. honestly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.03 21/02/99

- the socket-eof-hoops-do-i-really-consume-100%-cpu-time-now? has
  now finally been fixed
  
- i wonder why i haven't noticed this bug earlier:
  if some person did a "/msg NiCk hey!" but your nick
  was really "nick" (uncapitalized) then muh didn't
  notice the message was for it (same for ctcps etc)

- wrote some doc and made the whole stuff using autoconf.
  i'm quite new to this autoconf-stuff so if i made
  a mistake please let me know!

- the motd isn't requested every time a client connects
  to muh - some useful information is displayed instead

- fixed some other tiny bugs i really don't remember

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.02 23/09/98

- oh no, why in the world have i released 2.01 without noticing
  *this* bug? there was a really stupid bug with the op-message
  and the /me that's performed when the client disconnects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.01 22/09/98

- fixed a stupid bug that made muh crash at startup (glibc didn't mind)

- removed all the %as-scan-thingies so muh is *supposed*
  to work with ansi-c compilers again (infact i've tested
  it under freebsd and it worked superb)

- added a anti-idle 'feature'

- made the awaynotice configurable

- made connect() work with freebsd (it never worked until now!)

- PONG-replies by the server weren't filtered properly

- fixed some minor bugs

- okeiokei, muh now works with sick-identifying-clients like pirch

- muh now sends an additional +o-message when reintroducing a channel
  where muh's opped (kvirc-author: scan the names reply more carefully!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0 11/09/98

- it's stable!

- it's backdoor-free! (err, it has always been backdoor-free, really! :)

- it's configurable now! just create a ~/.muh/-dir and copy
  the muhrc there!

- full CTCP-support (ping, version, clientinfo, ...)

- when it receives a message while no client is connected
  it lets the messaging person know that nobody's there
  (there's a flood-protection of course, it means it
  sends this message only once to every hostname - same
  with the ctcp-messages btw)

- muh supports commands from now on, see /muh help for details
  (you might have to type /quote muh help or /raw muh help
  depending on your irc-client)

- most of the bugs i got reported (thanks guys!) were
  corrected (or is it all of the bugs? i dunno)
  
- muh should work on all the major networks now (irc,dal,under)
  the main-problem was that other ircd-versions than the one
  used on irc-net don't support PRIVMSG's in nick!user@host-format
  
- muh can be bound to a specific ip-address (in case the machine
  muh's running on has more than one ip-address)
  
- you might still get the bad-password-error when connecting with
  irc-clients like pirch...bug the author of the irc-client,
  it's not my fault! the suggested order for authenticating
  password-protected irc-sessions is PASS-NICK-USER (RFC1459) -
  if some windoze-coders are too stupid to follow that suggestion
  then their users should suffer from that :)
  
- muh checks if the connection between muh<->server and muh<->client
  is still alive...if not it either jumps server or drops
  the client

- the greeting-message (blahblah Welcome to IRC nick!user@host) is
  corrected so some irc-clients shouldn't get confused any more
  (like thinking they're really 'nick' or they're really running from
  'host')

- muh won't crash no more when connecting with a rev-dns-entry-less :)
  machine

- i think that's it for now, see for yourself what else changed
