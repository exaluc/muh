installing muh:

- type './configure' to configure muh or './configure --enable-local'
  if you'd like to install muh locally in your account
- type 'make' to compile
- type 'make install' to install muh

ipv6 support is not automatically compiled in, as muh does not currently
support using both ipv4 and ipv6 protocols at once.  
give '--enable-ipv6' to configure to enable it.

(see ./configure --help to change default-dirs for 'make install')

muh is in active development so visit the muh-site for new versions regularly.
