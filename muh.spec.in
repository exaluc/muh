%description 
Muh is a smart and versatile irc-bouncing tool for unix. The difference between Muh and other bouncers is that Muh
will go on irc as soon as it's launched, guarding or attempting to get your nick.
Control over the session can be taken as with other bouncers, by simply connecting to muh (and providing a
password) like you would connect to a normal irc-server.
On disconnect, Muh is able to stay in the channels and to reintroduce them to your client on your next connect.
Other handy features are message-logging, flood-protection, dcc-bouncing, etc.
